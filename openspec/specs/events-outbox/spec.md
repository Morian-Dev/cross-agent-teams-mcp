# events-outbox Specification

## Purpose

Provide an append-only, team-scoped events table that underpins message, contract, and task projections, plus cursor-based replay and bounded retention.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Events table schema

The SQLite database SHALL contain an `events` table with columns `event_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`, `from_team TEXT NOT NULL`, `to_team TEXT NOT NULL`, `event_type TEXT NOT NULL`, `actor_agent_id TEXT`, `payload TEXT NOT NULL /* JSON */`, `created_at TEXT NOT NULL /* ISO8601 */`. It MUST carry two composite indexes: `idx_events_from_team_eventid (from_team, event_id)` and `idx_events_to_team_eventid (to_team, event_id)`. It MUST NOT carry any index keyed on a single `team` column.

For all event types other than cross-team `send_message` (e.g. `contract_registered`, `task_added`, `task_claimed`, `task_completed`, `agent_registered`, `broadcast` messages, `broadcast_to_role` messages, same-team `send_message`), the writer MUST set `from_team = to_team`. Only cross-team `send_message` may produce rows where `from_team != to_team`.

#### Scenario: Fresh database creates events table with both team-scoped indexes

- **WHEN** the daemon bootstraps a fresh `data.db`
- **THEN** `PRAGMA table_info('events')` lists columns including `from_team` and `to_team` (both NOT NULL), and does NOT include a plain `team` column
- **AND** `PRAGMA index_list('events')` contains both `idx_events_from_team_eventid` and `idx_events_to_team_eventid`
- **AND** `PRAGMA index_list('events')` does NOT contain `idx_events_team_eventid`

#### Scenario: Non-cross-team event must have equal from_team and to_team

- **WHEN** the daemon appends any event with `event_type != 'message_sent'`, or a `message_sent` event from `broadcast` / `broadcast_to_role` / same-team `send_message`
- **THEN** the inserted row has `from_team == to_team`

### Requirement: Event append returns monotonically increasing event_id

Every call to `EventsOutbox.append({from_team, to_team, event_type, actor_agent_id?, payload})` SHALL return the inserted row's `event_id`. The `from_team` and `to_team` parameters are required and MUST be strings.

Successive appends SHALL return strictly increasing `event_id` values (globally monotonic — the index is across all teams, not per-team).

#### Scenario: Two appends return increasing ids

- **GIVEN** an empty events table
- **WHEN** `append({from_team:'default', to_team:'default', event_type:'x', payload:{}})` is called twice
- **THEN** the second returned id is greater than the first

#### Scenario: Cross-team append records differing from/to teams

- **WHEN** `append({from_team:'alpha', to_team:'beta', event_type:'message_sent', actor_agent_id:'sess-A', payload:{...}})` is called
- **THEN** the inserted row has `from_team='alpha'` and `to_team='beta'`

### Requirement: Team-scoped fan-out query

`EventsOutbox.since({team, since_event_id, limit})` SHALL return rows where `to_team = :team AND event_id > :since_event_id`, ordered by `event_id` ascending, capped by `limit` (default 100, max 500). The `team` parameter filters by `to_team` — i.e. events **targeted at** the named team — because consumers are reading their inbox.

Rows where `from_team = :team` but `to_team != :team` (i.e. the team's outbound cross-team messages) MUST NOT be returned by `since({team})`.  If callers need an outbound audit view, a separate query method is expected (not required by this Requirement).

#### Scenario: Cursor-based pagination returns events targeted at the team

- **GIVEN** events: (1) `from=alpha, to=alpha`, (2) `from=alpha, to=alpha`, (3) `from=alpha, to=beta`, (4) `from=beta, to=alpha`, (5) `from=alpha, to=alpha`
- **WHEN** `since({team:'alpha', since_event_id:0, limit:10})` is queried
- **THEN** the returned rows have event_ids exactly `[1, 2, 4, 5]`
- **AND** event_id 3 (alpha's outbound to beta) is excluded

#### Scenario: since(team) does not leak events targeting other teams

- **GIVEN** events in team `beta` with ids 6..10 (all from_team=to_team='beta')
- **WHEN** `since({team:'default', since_event_id:0, limit:10})` is queried
- **THEN** the returned rows contain none of ids 6..10

### Requirement: Thirty-day uniform cleanup of mailbox-derived tables

A cleanup routine SHALL run periodically (default every 1 hour, overridable via `CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS`) and delete every row in `events`, `messages`, and `message_delivery_status` that satisfies a uniform 30-day age threshold:

- `messages` rows where `sent_at < now - 30d`
- `message_delivery_status` rows whose `message_id` references a `messages` row marked for deletion
- `events` rows where `created_at < now - 30d`

The deletion MUST execute as a single SQLite transaction in child-to-parent order (`message_delivery_status` → `messages` → `events`) so that no foreign-key reference is dangling at any observable point. The `runCleanup` function MUST return the total number of rows deleted across all three tables.

The 30-day threshold is hard — it MUST NOT be gated by `last_processed_event_id` of any agent, online or otherwise. Agents that have been offline for more than 30 days forfeit any unread mail.

The cleanup routine MUST NOT delete:

- Rows newer than 30 days (regardless of read status).
- Rows in tables other than the three listed above.

#### Scenario: Cleanup deletes 31-day-old rows across all three tables in one transaction

- **GIVEN** an `events` row with `event_id=42`, `created_at = now - 31d`, plus a `messages` row with `event_id=42`, `sent_at = now - 31d`, plus a `message_delivery_status` row keyed by that message
- **WHEN** `runCleanup` runs
- **THEN** all three rows are deleted
- **AND** the deletions occur in the order: `message_delivery_status` first, `messages` second, `events` last
- **AND** the call returns a non-zero `deleted` count

#### Scenario: Cleanup leaves <30-day rows intact

- **GIVEN** an `events` row with `created_at = now - 29d` plus its paired `messages` and `message_delivery_status` rows
- **WHEN** `runCleanup` runs
- **THEN** none of the three rows are deleted

#### Scenario: Cleanup ignores last_processed_event_id

- **GIVEN** all online agents in team `default` have `last_processed_event_id = 0`
- **AND** events / messages / delivery status rows older than 30 days exist
- **WHEN** `runCleanup` runs
- **THEN** those old rows are deleted regardless of any agent's cursor position

#### Scenario: Cleanup leaves agents, tasks, contracts untouched

- **GIVEN** an `agents` row with `registered_at = now - 90d`, a `tasks` row with `created_at = now - 90d`, and a `contracts` row with `registered_at = now - 90d`
- **WHEN** `runCleanup` runs
- **THEN** all three rows remain

### Requirement: Cleanup does not touch current-state tables

The cleanup routine SHALL only operate on `events`, `messages`, and `message_delivery_status`. Rows in `agents`, `tasks`, `contracts`, `contract_subscriptions` MUST NOT be affected by age-based cleanup.

The `messages` and `message_delivery_status` tables are projections of the events outbox (each `messages` row carries `event_id REFERENCES events(event_id)` and each `message_delivery_status` row is keyed by `message_id`), so cleanup deletes them in lock-step with the underlying events to preserve referential integrity. Other current-state tables (`agents`, `tasks`, `contracts`, `contract_subscriptions`) carry no time-bounded retention contract and survive cleanup forever.

#### Scenario: Ancient contracts survive cleanup

- **GIVEN** a contract registered 60 days ago
- **WHEN** cleanup runs
- **THEN** the contract row remains in the `contracts` table

#### Scenario: Ancient agent rows survive cleanup

- **GIVEN** an agent row with `registered_at = now - 90d` and `last_seen_at = now - 90d`
- **WHEN** cleanup runs
- **THEN** the `agents` row remains

#### Scenario: Ancient tasks survive cleanup

- **GIVEN** a `tasks` row with `created_at = now - 90d` and `status='completed'`
- **WHEN** cleanup runs
- **THEN** the row remains in the `tasks` table

### Requirement: SQLite PRAGMAs on bootstrap

On first connection to the database, the daemon SHALL apply: `journal_mode=WAL`, `busy_timeout=5000`, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `foreign_keys=ON`.

#### Scenario: PRAGMAs applied after bootstrap

- **WHEN** daemon opens the database
- **THEN** `PRAGMA journal_mode` returns `wal`
- **AND** `PRAGMA busy_timeout` returns `5000`
- **AND** `PRAGMA foreign_keys` returns `1`
